# libffi

Fork from the original [libffi](https://github.com/libffi/libffi) which can be compiled using the [Cmake](https://cmake.org/) build system. This project is meant to help the build of [Calculate Binding](https://github.com/newlawrence/Calculate_Binding) project, so the number of platforms supported may be lower than the original's (at first, mainly **x86**).

##### Library version 3.2.1
